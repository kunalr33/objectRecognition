# Object_Recognition

In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) deployed for object recognition. More specifically, we will be using the All-CNN network published in the 2015 ICLR paper, "Striving For Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net". This paper can be found at the following link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf.

Model accuracy is 90.88%.
